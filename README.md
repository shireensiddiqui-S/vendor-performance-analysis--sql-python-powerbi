# 🛒 Vendor Performance Analysis – Retail Inventory & Sales

This project focuses on **analyzing vendor performance** in a retail business by exploring **inventory, sales, and supply chain data**.  
The goal was to identify **top-performing vendors**, analyze **inventory efficiency**, and visualize **key business KPIs** to help make data-driven decisions.

## 📊 Project Overview

Retail companies often deal with multiple vendors supplying thousands of products.  
Tracking which vendors perform best in terms of **sales, inventory turnover, and delivery efficiency** can be challenging.  

In this project, I performed:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python  
- **Data Cleaning and Querying** using SQL  
- **Interactive Dashboard Creation** using Power BI  
- GitHub

The analysis provides insights into:
- Brands for Promotional or Pricing Adjustmaents 
- Top Vendors by Sales & Purchase Contribution
- Impact of Bulk Purchasing on Cost Savings 
- Identifying Vendors with low Inventory Turnover
- Profit Margin Comparison: High vs.Low-Performing Vendors
- Statistical Validation of Profit Margin Differences

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

### Key Steps:
- Data cleaning: handled missing values, outliers, and duplicates  
- Feature engineering: created new metrics such as `Stock_Turnover_Rate` and `Profit_Margin`  
- Univariate & Bivariate analysis: distribution of sales, vendor comparison, etc.  
- Correlation analysis between inventory and sales performance  

📈 Power BI Dashboard

Created an interactive Power BI dashboard with multiple visuals:

Dashboard Highlights:

📚 Project Workflow

- Data Collection & Cleaning – Prepared raw retail and vendor data

- Exploratory Data Analysis – Discovered trends and patterns using Python

- SQL Analysis – Extracted and aggregated vendor-level metrics

- Dashboard Creation (Power BI) – Built visuals for decision-making insights

- Documentation (GitHub) – Created professional project README

Final Recommendations
- Re-evaluate pricing for low-sales, high-margin brands to boost sales volume without sacrificing profitability.
- Diversify vendor partnership to reduce dependency on a few suppliers and mitigate supply chain risks.
- Leverage bulk purchasing advantages to maintain competitive pricing while optimizing inventory management.
- Optimize slow-moving inventory by adjusting purchase quantities, launching clearance sales, or revising storage strategies.
- Enhance marketing and distribution strategies for low-performing vendors to drive higher sales volumes without compromising profit margins.
- By implementing these recommendations, the company can achieve sustainable profitability, mitigate risks, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
